      <h3> Your Pet's Nutrition Needs Compared to Yours.</h3>
      <h5> What kind of nutrition does your cat or dog really need to stay healthy?</h5>
      <p>Pet nutrition needs are not the same as ours, but many of us are clueless about what exactly they are.
      This primer on dog and cat nutrition will find out in on what your pet needs to stay healthy and fit</p>
      <p>consider these facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Small, low-activity dogs need only about 185 to 370 calories daily, while a large pooch between 67-88 pounds may need between 1,000 to 2,000 calories,
          depending on activity level and gender. Yet many of our dogs get far more food than they need.  </li>
        <li>A healthy 10-pound kitty needs just 220-350 calories a day about the number in a few ounces of cheese.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The Meat of Matter</h4>
      <p>Cats need twice as much proteins as humans and dogs do.Adult humans need 17-21% calories from proteins while ctas need double this amount from fish and meat.
      They require a vital amino acid called <strong>Taurine</strong> critical for a cat's normal heart, eye, and reproductive function. </p>

      <p>Proteins should make up about 18% of your dog's diet as human and they can aso eat and very well enjoy vegetables</p>

      <h4>Fat Facts</h4>
      <p>Fats are a good source of energy for cats and dogs. They also get the fatty acids they need and aid in absorbing fat-solubule vitamins like Vitamins A,D and E.
      Cats sometimes enjoy the taste of fat too much and as a result may end up becoming obese which can cause athritis and diabetes</p>
      <p>Dogs need fat to keep their coat, skin,nose and paw pads healthy. 9-15%  of an adult dog's calories should vcome from fat.</p>

      <h4>Water is vital</h4>
      <p>Animals can't survive without plenty of clean water, and your pet is no different. Refill the water bowl daily and be sure to give her extra water after along walk ors game </p>
